 * at most ~4 M sampled pixels, so no allocation. Blocks that are not film
 * are skipped: holder metal (a block mean at 4 D, or >= 4 of its 16 pixels
 * at T <= 0.002 in every channel, which also catches a block on a metal
 * edge; the slide base only skips the T floor), blocks with a non-finite
 * value and, for the film base, any clear pixel (open beam, T > 0.9 in
 * every channel). Limit: film denser than ~2.8 D looks like metal to the
 * scanner and cannot be told apart.
 * Several frames pool their statistics (one setting for a roll). The film
 * base normally comes from the preview (ft_layout.base, job key
 * film_base); ft_render_base_from_frames is the fallback when a scan has
 * none. */
