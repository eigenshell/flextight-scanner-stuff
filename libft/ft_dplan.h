 * A detailed scan (3150 or 6300 ppi, always bin 1: the most light) groups
 * the selected frames into passes: one scan window each, scanning through
 * any unselected frames between. A pass has one focus setting, and the
 * film is not flat along a strip (~1900 tandem steps of height variation
 * measured 2026-10-14, beyond the depth of focus at these
 * magnifications), so the frames of one pass must have focus offsets
 * within FT_DETAIL_DOF_SPAN of each other. Among the groupings that keep
 * every frame in focus, an exact DP picks the fastest (ft_scan_seconds:
 * every pass pays the fixed part and the calibration lines). */
