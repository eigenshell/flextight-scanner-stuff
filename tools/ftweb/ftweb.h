/* ftweb: the web page's engine (ftweb.wasm). Everything the page does
 * with pixels and files is here, in C on libft's browser tier; the page's
 * JS only moves bytes between the box (GET/PUT), this engine and the DOM.
 *
 * One strip at a time (one ftw): its strip.job and strip.print, and the
 * share frames cut from its window scans. Cutting and printing go
 * through the same libft calls as ftdev cut + ftdev print --roll
 * (ft_share_cut, ft_share_print_frame), and each frame is kept as the
 * DNG would keep it (16-bit samples, ppi and noise profile as stored,
 * the sidecar through its text), so the JPEG bytes are the CLI's
 * (tests/test_ftweb.py).
 *
 * Calls return 0 (or a count) or -1 with ftw_error() set. Results that
 * are bytes (JSON, file texts, JPEG, zip) go to the out buffer:
 * ftw_out() / ftw_out_len(), valid until the next call that fills it. */
