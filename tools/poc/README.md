# ftpoc — FlexTight II proof-of-concept

Standalone Win32 console tool that talks to the scanner **without
FlexColor**, through the same `\\.\ScannerN` + 44-byte SRB +
`DeviceIoControl(0x190012)` transport FlexColor uses, validated against
hundreds of thousands of traced calls between FlexColor and our scanner.

## Why this exists

It's the de-risking step before the Linux SG_IO driver: if a single-file
C program can move the holder and pull pixels on Windows with the protocol
spec alone, the spec is right and the driver is just a port. If not, we
learn what the spec got wrong — cheaply.

## Usage (on the scanner box, FlexColor CLOSED — the driver opens exclusively)

### Smart scanning

```
ftpoc frames [--film neg|slide] [--ppi 2000] [--sprockets yes|no]
             [--preview standard|1000|1500] [-h s] [-o strip]
             [--share 2000 [--select 1,3-6,8-12] [--hf-half-res on|off]]
ftpoc scan --job strip.job [-h s]
ftpoc calibrate-focus <x_mm> <y_mm> <w_mm> [-h s]
```

`frames` scans a preview, finds every frame (full, half, panorama,
partial; blank frames dropped and counted, unexposed film at the strip
ends reported apart), checks focus at the first, middle and last frame,
and writes `strip.job` plus `strip.png` (numbered boxes; dim yellow =
excluded, orange = low confidence). Edit `strip.job` — `include`,
`ppi`, `sprockets`, `straighten`, `window` per frame — then run
`scan --job`. Detected windows are clamped to the holder's crop limits
(32 mm across, 231 mm along; the preview itself reaches 0.92..33.14 mm
across and ~232 mm along); if the job would still be refused, `frames`
warns per frame and writes it anyway.

`--preview` picks the preview (`scan preview`, `scan preview1000`,
`scan preview1500` take it alone). Previews are for framing: all three
use the fast, high-magnification optics.

| mode | ppi | optics / bin | time (strip) |
|---|---|---|---|
| standard | 525 | 6300 / 12 (FlexColor's) | ~40 s |
| 1000 | 1000 | 6000 / 6 | ~2.7 min |
| 1500 | 1500 | 6000 / 4 | ~5.7 min |

`strip.raw` keeps the full-resolution preview (render it with
`ftraw.py`); detection and `strip.png` use a copy box-averaged to
~500 ppi.

#### Scan to share (`frames --share`)

A share scan is its own scan, not a detail scan resampled down: the
lowest magnification that still gives the target size on each frame's
long side (the detected frame, not the window with the hole rows) puts
the most light on every sample, so Dmax is higher and noise lower.
`--share 2000` plans it: the frames you `--select` (job frame numbers;
default every frame that is not partial) at the needed ppi (2000 px on
36 mm: 1412; the optics floor is 1500), every usable bin priced (scan
time, focus time, light, Dmax), the one with the most light chosen.
`--hf-half-res on` gives half frames the full frame's ppi: the same
optics and Dmax, ~1333 px on their 24 mm side.

The stock firmware scans one window per scan and calibrates every time
(the holder travels out and back: that is what makes the film creep
between runs), so selected frames next to each other share a window and
an unselected frame between them splits it when skipping it is faster
(it always is for a whole frame: ~34 s per window against ~210 s per
full frame at 1500 ppi bin 1). The job gets `share` and `hf_half_res`,
and each frame a `group` (its window). Focus: the job gets `focus =
per-frame`, which on a share job means one bracket in `scan --job`, on
the first window at its own optics (its ppi and bin), on the centre
band of its first frame (the next one if that gives no peak); ~5 crops,
~1 min. A focus offset moves the CCD and the lens together, so it moves
the film-side focus plane by the same steps at any scale: later windows
take the curve with that offset and no crops, except a 3-crop check
where a window's scale (ppi x bin) is above 1.25 x the measured one
(less depth of field). Until a window finds a peak, each window gets
the full bracket. Each window's frames keep their offset as
`focus_offset` (a resumed run starts there). `focus = shifted` scans
with the curve and the strip's `focus_offset` as they are, no bracket.

`scan --job` on a share job scans each group as one window, 2 mm beyond
its first and last frame and the full film width (`<jobbase>_winNN.raw`,
the share keys appended to its `.txt`). Then, on any OS:

```
ftdev cut strip_win01.raw          # -> strip_frameNN.dng + .dng.txt
ftdev export strip_frame03.dng     # -> strip_frame03.jpg, 2000 px, sRGB
```

`cut` finds the frames again in the window's own pixels (the film moved
since the preview), cuts each with 0.5 mm bleed and writes the working
raw (linear 16-bit DNG) plus a sidecar (frame box, export scale, film
base; a frame detection missed is cut at its preview box, moved by the
others' shift, and flagged `estimated`). `export` renders (the render
flags of `-f positive`), crops to the frame (`--crop x,y,w,h` in DNG
pixels), resizes in linear light to the share size (`--long-edge px`
for another), maps colour to `--space srgb|p3|adobe` (`--gamut soft`,
the default, compresses only saturated colours near the edge; `clip`
clamps) and writes an 8-bit JPEG with its ICC profile; `--raw-too` also
copies the DNG next to it.

A size per frame (the web page's 4MP / 6MP): `ftdev plan` re-plans a
job on any OS, without the scanner:

```
ftdev plan strip.job --size 4mp:1-2,5 --size 6mp:3   # 4mp 2450, 6mp 3000 px
```

Frames not named are excluded. Each run of frames of one size (in strip
order) is planned as `--share` plans a strip, and runs never share a
window; the strip's `share` is the smallest size and frames of another
size carry `share_px`. Any px works too (`--size 2000:1-6`); `-o` writes
another file.

`--progress` (frames, scan) adds machine-readable lines for the web
server; the rest of the output stays as it is:

```
progress begin window 3        a run of 3 units (preview|window|frame|pass)
progress unit window 2 5       unit 2 of the run: the job's window 5
progress lines 812/1890        lines read of that unit's scan
progress focus 2 frame 4 at -500   focus crop 2 of that unit (before
                               its scan): frame 4's band, offset -500
progress sharp -500 0.0412     that crop's sharpness
progress focused +620 measured the unit's offset: measured | checked |
                               carried (no crops) | none (no peak)
progress file strip_win05.raw  a finished file
progress end ok                ok | stopped | failed | refused
```

#### Optics per frame (the job's `bin` key, `crop -b`)

Any bin dividing 12 whose optics (ppi x bin) lie in 1500..6300 gives
the same output ppi. The trade-off, measured 2026-10-13:

- **Time follows bin**: the stock firmware costs ~84k output px/s for
  the full CCD line (7992 / bin px) whatever the window, so bin 1 is
  ~2x slower than bin 2 and ~12x slower than bin 12 at the same lines.
- **Light follows magnification**: a smaller bin is a lower
  magnification m, ~1/(1+m)^2 more light on every sample. The firmware
  does not average a bin (it keeps one CCD pixel), so a small bin also
  aliases less. Per-read Dmax (R): ~3.0 at 6300 optics, 3.60 at 2000,
  3.58 at 1500 (white near the ADC top there; ~3.73 is the ceiling).

`frames` prints every option per included frame (time, light per
sample, Dmax estimate) and totals; the job file lists them under each
frame. `bin = 0` (the default) is the fastest. Across the film the
low-magnification optics are mapped with a measured correction (below
scale 3150; libft/ft_geom.c), so crops land where intended.

Job file keys (`key = value`, `#` starts a comment anywhere):

share_px      share jobs only, optional: this frame's px on its long side

```

Jobs written by this ftpoc contain `film_base` (and share jobs `share`,
`hf_half_res`, `group`, `share_px`), which older ftpoc builds reject ("unknown
key"); rebuild ftpoc on the scanner box before using them.

`scan --job` validates the job and runs every remaining frame's scan
window through the crop checks before the scanner does anything; a
refused frame is listed then, skipped, left `done = no`, and makes the
exit status non-zero (the other frames are still scanned). Each frame
is scanned slightly wider than its window (tilt + 0.3 mm, clipped to the
holder and to what the CCD reaches at that ppi) into
`<jobbase>_frameNN.raw`, where `<jobbase>` is the job path without its
extension (`neg.job` -> `neg_frame01.raw`, `neg_frame02.raw`, ...), so
scans of different jobs never overwrite each other (+ `.cal`, `.faul`,
`.txt`); the tight crop is appended to the matching `.raw.txt`
(`crop_x/y/w/h` in output pixels of the scan as sent,
plus `tilt`, `straighten`, `focus_offset`, and `film_base` when the job
has one). `crop_y`/`crop_h` count rows
of the RGB-aligned image (as `ftraw.py` writes it): row r is the scan's
green row r + k, k = 12 / bin lines dropped at each end. The job file is rewritten
after every frame (via `strip.job.tmp`, renamed over it), with finished
frames marked `done = yes`, so a run stopped by Ctrl+C or a failed scan
resumes where it left off.

Hold: the first scan of a run holds at least 10 s before its
calibration, whatever was asked, except that `-h` on `frames`,
`scan --job` and `calibrate-focus` sets that first hold explicitly
(0..120 s, e.g. `-h 35` after a cold power-up, `-h 0` when the lamp is
already warm). Their later scans hold 3 s.

Ctrl+C: scans (`scan`, `crop`, `frames`, `scan --job`,
`calibrate-focus`) stop at the next line read and send END; `park` and
`goto` finish their current move (Ctrl+C is held until then); `move`
stops before its next step. No new scan or move starts afterwards.
Other commands are stopped by Ctrl+C at once, as before.

Focus: the curve comes from `focus.txt` in the current directory
(written there by `calibrate-focus` on a textured window) or the
built-in curve for the development scanner. Below scale ~3000 the
thin-lens curve drifts from the true focus (focus survey 2026-10-15/16,
the same trend on three films): the built-in curve carries a correction
per scale, tandem steps added to the CCD and the lens alike, linear
between its points: -11278 at 1200, -4778 at 1500, -1358 at 2000, 0 from
3000 up. `focus.txt` may carry its own (`correct = <scale> <offset>`
lines, scales ascending); a fitted `focus.txt` (`calibrate-focus`) has
none. Focus offsets move the CCD
and the lens together (tandem, as the manual's manual focus does): the
gap between them, and so the magnification, stays, and only the focus
plane on the film side moves. Moving the CCD alone also changes the
magnification (~1 % for 9000 steps at 6300 ppi) and is ~5x less
sensitive. The check points and the per-frame brackets step 500 and stay
within ±4000 of the curve. A share window's bracket steps half its depth
of field (~980 (1+m)/m^2 x bin tandem steps for 95 %, m = p x scale;
~2200 at 1705 ppi bin 1), at least 500, and may reach as far as it
spans. If the three check points agree within ±300
steps of their mean the curve is shifted by the mean; otherwise every
frame gets its own focus bracket before it is
scanned, centred on its `focus_offset` (the strip's when 0); a frame
with no usable peak is scanned at that centre, with a warning. Focus
crops go to the scratch files `fb.raw`, `fb.raw.cal`, `fb.raw.faul`
and `fb.raw.txt`, overwritten by each crop.

`calibrate-focus` (which finds the curve itself, so it is the one place
that moves the CCD alone) brackets the CCD, lens on the current curve, at eight
optical scales (3800..6300) on a 1 mm band at `y` across `x..x+w`
(clipped to the CCD's reach): the first usable scale gets a coarse
bracket (5 crops, 3000 steps, moving up to ±12000 if the peak is at an
edge), then each scale a fine one (9 crops, 1000 steps) around the
coarse peak or the previous scale's. Scales without a usable peak are
skipped. The magnification at each peak follows from the current curve
(moving the CCD by d shortens the image distance by d), and the
thin-lens curve is fitted to the peaks. It writes `focus.txt` only with
at least six usable scales, rms residuals of at most 600 CCD and 300
lens steps, every point within ±1200 CCD steps of the fit, and a curve
that keeps every measured scale inside FlexColor's positions. Brackets
never leave ±12000 steps of the current curve; a peak further off is
skipped like any other unusable scale.

### Detailed scans (archive files)

```
ftpoc frames --detail neg|pos --ppi 3150|6300 [--select 1,3-6]
             [--fmt dng|tiff] [--bw off|mono|rgb] [--keep-raw yes|no]
             [--ring-mb N] [--film neg|slide] [-h s] [-o strip]
ftpoc scan --job strip.job [-h s]
```

For files to keep and process later, not to edit on the box:

- `--detail neg` writes a **digital negative** per frame: linear 16-bit
  transmittance (x 65535, uninverted), tiled DNG (`--fmt dng`, the
  default; LinearRaw with the scanner colour matrix) or TIFF (`--fmt
  tiff`, with a linear ICC profile). For Negative Lab Pro, Lightroom,
  darktable. Slides use this too: their negative is the positive.
- `--detail pos` (negative film only) writes a **flat archive
  positive**: per channel the density above the film base, 16-bit, as
  Kodak's Cineon stored film: `code = round((D - D_base + 0.1) / 4.0 x
  65535)`. The film base sits at code 1638, so noise thinner than the
  base is kept; denser film is a higher code, so the file is a flat,
  log-looking positive with the orange mask gone. No curve, no
  exposure, no clipping, no colour matrix: grade it later. The
  constants are in the TIFF's ImageDescription and the sidecar. For
  b/w: `--bw mono` (default for b/w work: one channel, the three
  channels' densities averaged by inverse noise, measured on the white
  reference) or `--bw rgb` (three channels, e.g. chromogenic films).
- 8-bit outputs do not exist here: make them in post.

`frames --detail` previews at the scan's **own optics** (6300:
FlexColor's standard preview; 3150: 525 ppi at the 3150 optics, bin 6),
so the preview's light level and Dmax are the scan's. It then brackets
focus on every selected frame at bin 1 (~1 min each; the film is not
flat along a strip, ~1900 tandem steps measured) and groups the frames
into **passes**: the fewest scans such that every frame's focus offset
is within +-300 steps of its pass's (`libft/ft_dplan.h`; an estimate
until measured at these optics). It prints each pass (frames, window,
focus, time, file size) and writes the job (`detail*`, `keep_raw`,
`ring_mb` keys; a `pass` per frame).

`scan --job` checks every pass window and the **free space** (files +
5 %) before the scanner moves, then scans pass by pass. The scanner's
lines go into a RAM ring (`ring_mb`, 8..1024, default 64 MB: ~2 min of
a stalled disk at the scanner's ~0.5 MB/s; allocated before the scanner
moves) and a worker thread develops them
line by line (flat-field, Faul Pixs, RGB alignment), cuts each frame
(its preview box + 3 mm, for creep) and appends it to its tiled file:
nothing is held whole and every file is written once. The reader never
waits: a full ring stops the scan cleanly (`RING FULL`). At the end of
a pass frame detection runs on a 525 ppi copy; each frame's detected box
(its creep since the preview) goes into the DNG's DefaultCrop and the
sidecar `<frame>.txt` (`frame_box`, `shift_mm`, `estimated`, `edge`).
Files are `strip_frameNN.dng|.tif`, written as `.partial` and renamed
when complete; a failed or interrupted pass leaves its frames
`.partial` (finished passes are marked done and a re-run skips them;
resuming inside a pass is not supported). Every pass prints the ring's peak and the longest
single line: the numbers that tell whether a slower machine keeps up.

`--keep-raw yes` also keeps each pass as it arrived
(`strip_passNN.raw` + `.cal .faul .txt`, a second write);
`ftdev detail strip_pass01.raw --job strip.job [--out neg|pos]` develops
it again on any machine. `ftdev bench [--ppi 6300] [--pace] [--ring-mb
N]` measures the worker on the machine it runs on: without `--pace` its
speed against the scanner's line rate, with `--pace` a paced run into a
ring of that size.

## Device selection

The scanner answers on all 8 LUNs of its SCSI target, so Windows creates
several `\\.\ScannerN`; only one is live (on the session-4 box:
`Scanner4`). The rest fail every command with SRB status 0x13
(UNEXPECTED_BUS_FREE) → ERROR_IO_DEVICE 1117. `ftpoc` probes each and
uses the one whose INQUIRY says Imacon — the same thing FlexColor's
FindDevices does, and the source of its "first INQUIRYs fail" pattern.

## Safety model

- Every descriptor is one FlexColor sent, byte for byte, except for
  these fields: the resolution (BE u32 @10, `goto`/`move` on the idle
  template), the start line (BE u32 @18, `scan -y` — FlexColor's six 3f
  frames differ only in that field), the window of a synthesized `crop`,
  the CCD/lens positions (BE u32 @56/@60, `-p`; `crop` computes them
  from its focus model) and the lamp level (@76, `-l`). Each stays
  within the values FlexColor sent, and the CCD always stays below the
  lens.
- `frames`, `scan --job` and `calibrate-focus` force the lamp level to
  255 (full) on every scan: the level persists in the scanner, so a
  dimmed level left by an earlier `-l` must not leak into them.
- Resolution is limited to FlexColor's range (0..63000000 = 6300 ppi); the
  start line to the holder length at that resolution.
- Every command has a 5 s timeout (overlapped I/O + `CancelIo`), matching
  FlexColor's own 5 s wait.
- `maint` sends only the whitelisted packets described below.

## Maintenance writes and memory reads (`maint`)

The uploaded microcode treats WRITE BUFFER (`3b`) data as a maintenance
packet: a 10-byte header (`[0]` command, `[1..2]` and `[3..4]` big-endian
words W1/W2, `[9]` flags) followed by a payload. Command `01` writes the
payload to memory W1:W2, or with flags bit 0 to I/O port W1 (bit 2 keeps
the port instead of incrementing it). The device copies length − 10
bytes without checking, acts only once idle, and reports good status
before it acts. READ BUFFER (`3c`) is a memory read: segment in CDB
bytes 2–3, offset in 4–5, length in 6–8 (so FlexColor's Faul Pixs "page
e0 @ 0x400" is memory `E000:0400`).

`ftpoc maint` (built on `libft/ft_maint.c`) can send only:

    ftpoc maint io 0x342 <byte> --confirm        FPGA mode register
    ftpoc maint io 0x344 <byte> --confirm        FPGA register, meaning under test
    ftpoc maint mem 4000:<off> <hex> --confirm   timing table 4000:7640..76BB
    ftpoc maint peek 3000:<off> <len>            microcode, len <= 0x400
    ftpoc maint peek 4000:<off> <len>            data segment, len <= 0x400
    ftpoc maint peek c000:<off> <len>            loader ROM C000:0000..7FFF
    ftpoc maint peek e000|f000:<off> <len>       upper chip select, len <= 0x400
    ftpoc maint dump-flash <file>                E000..FFFF, then C000..C7FF

`dump-flash` writes the non-volatile memory to one 160 KiB file in READ
BUFFER reads of 1 KiB, the first identical to FlexColor's own `e0` page
read: E000:0000..F000:FFFF (parameter flash with the Faul Pixs table at
E000:0400, the 386EX reset stub at F000:C000), then the loader ROM at
C000:0000..7FFF (chip select 3; the reset stub jumps to C000:3CDF). It is
the backup that makes a damaged flash recoverable with a chip
programmer: take it twice in a row and keep it if both files match.
C800..D7FF (chip selects 0 and 1, unidentified devices) is never read.
Keep the dump outside the repo (vendor firmware).

Every other command code is refused: among them `00` (jump), `02` (FPGA
configuration) and the flash commands `10`/`20`/`30`/`50`. Flash writes
are the only permanent change the protocol allows. So are every other
port (the motor DACs, the output latch, the SCSI chip, the 386EX
peripherals and the FPGA control register `0x340`) and every other
memory range. Each `maint` call checks that the scanner is idle first and
polls until it is idle again.

Everything `maint` can change lives in RAM: power-cycling the scanner
(≥ 10 s off) returns it to the loader, and `ftpoc upload MICROCOD.3XX`
restores the stock microcode. After any write, read it back with
`maint peek` and run a short preview before going further. Stop and
power off on grinding motors, an unexpected eject, a lamp change, an
unknown poll status or a scan that hangs for more than 30 s.

## Templates

All SetWindow templates are generated byte-for-byte from the session-4
sidecar (`flextrace_bufs.bin`, cand 0x60, when=0) and each carries a
compile-time size check. An earlier hand-typed copy dropped bytes and C
zero-padded the `[84]` array, which shifted every field: the scan
descriptor sent that way put the device into a scan it never finished
(df stuck at `0800`). Never hand-edit; regenerate.

`SCAN_WIN`/`END_WIN` come from session 5 (pid 412: a full preview and a
preview stopped halfway — both end with END ×2). The preview sequence
and its timing are documented in `cmd_scan` in ftpoc.c.
Seq 41–278 are *not* preview — they are the Position dialog's
"CCD & Optic" button (UI timeline), a service calibration that `ftpoc`
deliberately does not replay.

## Images: `ftraw.py`

```
python3 ftraw.py scan.raw --negative      # -> scan.png
python3 ftraw.py scan.raw --raw           # uncorrected, shows the lines
```

`<file>` is one block per line = px × RGB, u16 LE, linear. The scanner
does **not** correct its CCD: before every scan it sends 200 dark lines
and 50 white (open beam) lines, and the host corrects
`(raw − dark) / (white − dark)` per CCD pixel — FlexColor's
`CCalibrateLineHandler`. Without it, pixel gain differences show as fine
lines along the strip. Pixels in the device's Faul Pixs table flicker
line to line and are interpolated instead (output pixel j covers CCD
pixels `(x + j) × bin + 144 …`, `bin` = descriptor byte 51). The
tri-linear CCD's R and B rows are realigned to G by 12 / bin lines. `--negative`
is a rough inversion, not FlexColor's film profiles.
